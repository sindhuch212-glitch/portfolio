# JOIN Practice – Customer and Orders Data

## Project Overview
This project focuses on practicing SQL JOINs using two sample tables:
1. **CustomerData** – Stores customer information.
2. **Orders** – Stores order details linked to customers.

The goal is to learn how to combine data from these two tables using INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and conceptual FULL OUTER JOIN.

## Tables Used

### CustomerData
| CustomerID | Name        |
|------------|-------------|
| 1          | Ravi Kumar  |
| 2          | Priya Reddy |
| 3          | Ajay Sharma |
| 4          | Sneha Rao   |
| 5          | Kiran Patel |

### Orders
| OrderID | CustomerID | Product   |
|--------|------------|----------|
| 1      | 1          | Laptop   |
| 2      | 2          | Phone    |
| 3      | 1          | Headphones |
| 4      | 3          | Monitor  |
| 5      | 4          | Keyboard |

## JOIN Types Practiced
✔ INNER JOIN – Show only customers with orders  
✔ LEFT JOIN – Show all customers and orders if available  
✔ RIGHT JOIN – Show all orders and customers if available  
✔ FULL OUTER JOIN – Conceptual practice combining unmatched rows

## Learning Outcomes
- How to join data from multiple tables  
- Understanding matching and unmatched rows  
- Writing queries for business scenarios  
- Preparing for SQL interviews and reporting tasks

## Future Improvements
- Practice JOINs with more complex datasets  
- Explore advanced JOINs with filtering and grouping  
- Apply this knowledge to Power BI and Python projects
