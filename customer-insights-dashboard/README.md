# Customer Insights Dashboard

## Overview
This project is focused on analyzing customer behavior using SQL. It demonstrates how to extract, filter, and summarize data to create meaningful insights that can be used for reporting and decision-making. The dataset contains customer information including their spending patterns, demographics, and joining dates.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a simulated dataset named `customer_data.csv`, containing the following fields:

| CustomerID | Name        | Age | City      | JoinDate  | TotalSpent |
|------------|-------------|-----|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 1          | Ravi Kumar  | 28  | Hyderabad | 2023-01-15 | 5500      |
| 2          | Priya Reddy | 35  | Chennai   | 2022-11-20 | 8200      |
| 3          | Ajay Sharma | 42  | Mumbai    | 2023-03-10 | 4300      |
| 4          | Sneha Rao   | 30  | Bangalore | 2022-07-05 | 6700      |
| 5          | Kiran Patel | 25  | Hyderabad | 2023-05-01 | 3900      |

The dataset represents customers across multiple cities and includes details on their total spending and joining dates.

## Technologies Used
âœ” SQL (MySQL syntax used for learning and practice)  
âœ” DB Fiddle â€“ for practicing queries without needing to install software

## What I Learned
- How to create and structure tables using SQL
- Using `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and `ORDER BY` to filter and sort data
- Applying aggregation functions such as `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, `MAX()`, and `MIN()`
- Grouping data by city and analyzing customer behavior
- Using `HAVING` to filter grouped data

## Queries Practiced
1. Retrieve all customer details
2. Find customers from specific cities
3. Sort customers by age and spending
4. Calculate total and average spending
5. Count customers by city
6. Filter customers based on joining date and spending
7. Identify highest and lowest spending customers
8. Analyze customer distribution across cities

## Future Improvements
- Add more tables like Orders and Products to practice JOINs
- Explore real datasets from e-commerce or finance sectors
- Build dashboards using Power BI to visualize customer trends
